This React app allows users to manage a contact list with the following features:

Add Contacts: Users can add a contact by filling in the fields for name, email, and phone. Validation ensures the correct format for email and phone numbers.
View Contacts: The contact list is displayed with each contact's name. Clicking the contact's name shows additional details (email and phone).
Delete Contacts: Users can delete a contact with a confirmation prompt.
Sort Contacts: Contacts can be sorted alphabetically by name with a button click.
Persist Data: The contact list is stored in localStorage, so data persists even after the page is refreshed.

Key Components:
Header: Displays the title of the app ("Contact List").
Contacts: Manages the list of contacts, handles adding, deleting, sorting, and displaying contact details.
Add: A form for adding new contacts with input validation.
Contact: A single contact card with options to view details or delete the contact.
